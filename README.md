# warp-themes

### Setup

#### Mac Setup

In your root directory, create a directory called `.warp/themes` and clone the repo into the `themes` folder

> Once you have cloned into this folder, you can restart warp and when you select the themes in appearance settings, you will see the additional list of custom themes.

#### Alternative setup

If you do not want to clone the repo, you can simply just create the `.warp/themes` directory and copy the yaml file from the repo.
